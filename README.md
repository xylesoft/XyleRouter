Purpose
-------

A routing component to allow you to create a routing table which encompasses the following abilities:
	* Groups

	* Callback for match/unmatch based on tokens which must match data

	* Cutting of URLs

	* Defaulting of request values

	* Matching of request headers

	* URL matching with REGEX

	* Tree structure which allows for easy configuration interpretations to be implemented

	* Interfaces to implement your own moduling/controller calling.

Influence
---------

This routing implementation is heavily based upon the AgaviRouter (https://github.com/agavi/agavi) for inspiration.
